## Hey there, my name is Johannes, designer, developer and survival expert.

Well at least I survived the last 26 years. In this time I worked for a couple of companies and had a lot of great projects. From your local wood workshop to big car brands. I did concept work, design, programming, support and everything that is needed to make a great website.
So, if you're looking for a partner that can help you build your next awesome website, contact me and we will work something out.
